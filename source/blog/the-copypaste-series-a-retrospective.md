title: The copy/paste series - a retrospective
---

Episodes [51][], [52][], [53][], [54][], [55][], [58][], and [59][] are all on the topic of copy and paste in Vim. I think that this is one area where Vim is especially confusing, partly because of [Vim's non-standard jargon for cut, copy and paste operations][jargon]. It's not the most intuitive copy/paste system, but it's usable when you get the hang of certain concepts and techniques.
